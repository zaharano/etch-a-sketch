## Things and stuff
There's something I'm not getting about `this` which is probably fine given how instructors everywhere say it's hard to fully grasp. Maybe it more has to do with... how `this` works within object declarations at runtime. Anyway I *think* that trying to do this project in some OOP style is beyond what was expected, so my failure to do it that way is probably just fine...

Performance of the grayscale version at >100 or so grid size gets pretty bad. I don't know enough about DOM stuff to know if that's something that could be optimized by using some method other than setting opacity style directly on the cell. Or maybe this is something to do with async concerns, like just setting this to be async would fix the issue? Tblearned.
